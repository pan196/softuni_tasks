This is my second Jekyll post... so, yes - I am a Profecional ForntEnd developer!

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets. Upgraded code:

{% highlight ruby %}
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Hello, Jekyll World!</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>This is some very interesting text!</p>
	</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

The best Jekyll tutorial is [this one][brazil].
